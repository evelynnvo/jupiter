# jupiter

Named after the Roman god of thunder and the sky, Jupiter is a simple new tab override chrome extension that can give you the current weather. I made this to experiment with web development, so it's far from perfect!

To see jupiter in action, simply go to "Manage Extensions" in your Chrome browser, switch to developer mode, press "Load unpacked" and select the jupiter folder!
